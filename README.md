# E-Commerce

## Description

This project was built in order to use Sequalize to connect to a MySQL database, and add, alter, and delete information within that database. I built this project in order to learn how to connect a front end and a back end successfully. It allows for a user to easily add, alter, or delete a product, category, or tag.

This project solidified my knowledge of models, api routes, how to use Sequelize and MySQL, and how to tie everything together to be able to use Insomnia to do GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE routes.
